NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
```

### Backend Integration
- Ensure backend is running on port 5000
- Email service (Resend) must be configured
- Database must have updated schema

## üß™ Testing Checklist

### Manual Testing
- [ ] Register new user
- [ ] Check verification email received
- [ ] Click verification link
- [ ] Login with verified account
- [ ] Test forgot password flow
- [ ] Test resend verification
- [ ] Test password reset
- [ ] Test form validations
- [ ] Test responsive design
- [ ] Test error states

### Error Scenarios
- [ ] Invalid verification token
- [ ] Expired reset token
- [ ] Already verified email
- [ ] Non-existent email
- [ ] Weak passwords
- [ ] Network errors

## üöÄ Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
